# Task Auto Scheduler

## Introduction

Let's be honest, I am HORRIBLE at time management. It's been said to me many times that I should schedule my tasks in my calendar to block off time to do things.

This is my attempt at blocking time for tasks.

The idea behind this project is to be able to add a task to my todo list and then have it automatically schedule itself, broken down into manageble chunks of time.
